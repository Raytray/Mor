\subsection*{Overview}
\indent For this assignment, we decided to continue with our website and build some functionality. We have implemented \emph{accounts}, complete with logging in, logging out, and registration functionalities. We also have password recovery, and change password functionality. We have also implemented an adminstrator account which can be designated on specific users to enable to additional permissions.

\subsection*{Users}
\indent We have implemented two additional user types. This is ontop of the guest view only access that unregistered users are automatically given. Users, will register with their emails, and upon registration will be sent a short email welcoming them to the service, as well as providing them with additional information about our service. However at this time, the email functionality on our website is blocked by most email services as spam. This is a limitation that has to be bypassed by either finding an alternative host, or by upgrading the webhost.\\
\indent Users, once logged in, will see a dynamic page which no longer asks them to log in, and insteads ask them if they wish to log out. They will also find additional options such as account settings, which allows the user to change their password.\\
\indent Users are also able to save a specific major or minor that they have already declared in order to more quickly discover common minors in line with their majors. An interesting direction to take along this path is to enable users to save possibly majors and minors that they are interested in pursuing, and displaying the total minimum number of credits required to achieve both degrees.

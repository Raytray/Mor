\subsection*{Motivation}
Our main motivation for this website when we realized that many students had the question of \emph{`What could I possible minor or double major in easily?'}

\subsection*{Description}
The website has 5 pages. The main page is simply a news page and portal. There is a login page designed to allow users to customize their own courses and display possible course tracks that would lead to other majors. However this feature is not implemented at this time. The select page under \emph{Start Planning} is the primary functionality of the site currently. By selecting a course via the dropdown box, similar courses will appear in below. The about page displays the website's authors and a short description of them. The other links page displays other pages associated with the University of Virginia and Course planning.

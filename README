20:59:00  <   Juntray> k, so quick recap: 5 pages: Dropdown menu of (pick your) major + next + image scroll + popup; List of majors/minors in alphabetical order; Display similar major/minors + highlighted 
                       for loop + if statement of same prequisites; login page for profile/admins; about/link page

20:40:49  <   Juntray> Realistically, we can do this all on one page
20:40:54  <   Juntray> but! Because of arbitrary rules!
20:41:20  <   Juntray> 1 page: Dropdown box of majors.
20:41:43  <   Juntray> click next, POPUP!!!! (because everyone loves those...) confirming choice
20:41:48  < RichardLi> lol
20:42:02  < RichardLi> we can have a huge list of majors, in dropdowns by school
20:42:06  <   Juntray> 1 page: 2-3 courses listed as possible minors/majors with overlapping classes.
20:42:08  < RichardLi> or category
20:42:18  <   Juntray> with a FOR LOOP!!! highlighting overlapping classes.
20:42:27  < RichardLi> hah ok
20:42:36  < RichardLi> calendar view 
20:42:39  <   Juntray> 1 page: what you said. As another awy to get to this overlapping pages
20:42:48  <   Juntray> What does docuemnt write do?
20:42:52  < RichardLi> idk
20:43:05  <   Juntray> I hope we can highlght with for loops..
20:43:07  < RichardLi> pre req tree view
20:43:15  <   Juntray> see that one is harder
20:43:20  <   Juntray> Unelss we do pictures
20:43:24  <   Juntray> of ones already made
20:43:27  <   Juntray> we have the CS handbook one
20:43:30  <   Juntray> is there onef or CPE?
20:43:56  <   Juntray> oh
20:44:00  < RichardLi> pictures?
20:44:04  <   Juntray> document write, just code to print to the page
20:44:13  <   Juntray> so we can document write HI  VISITOR 212341234123412341234
20:44:24  < RichardLi> what does that mean
20:44:27  <   Juntray> Picutres of the pre rqeq trees
20:44:40  < RichardLi> no we generate our own trees
20:44:47  <   Juntray> How hard is it to do that?
20:44:54  <   Juntray> With xhtml
20:45:17  < RichardLi> well we can add other stuffright?
20:45:49  <   Juntray> yeah, but I'm not entirely sure how hard it is to generate trees and such you know? Especially sicne we'd then have to define each class with a parent/preq/etc.
20:45:53  < RichardLi> but just a possibly interactive(ROLLOVERS) map
20:45:56  < RichardLi> with lines connecting them
20:46:00  <   Juntray> oh
20:46:00  <   Juntray> yea
20:46:13  <   Juntray> so we have 3 pages down right now.
20:46:21  <   Juntray> one of those three pages can be the main page.
20:46:27  <   Juntray> (this really can be all one page >.>)
20:46:31  < RichardLi> lol
20:46:33  <   Juntray> a fake log in page
20:46:39  <   Juntray> or a fake logged in page, with a fake profile.
20:46:51  <   Juntray> whichi s form validation!
20:46:56  < RichardLi> advanced option later
20:47:03  <   Juntray> so that's 4 pages.
20:47:04  < RichardLi> to pull in classes youve taken or your major from sis
20:47:08  < RichardLi> or a transcript
20:47:23  <   Juntray> on the page with dropdown choice, we can do pictures of people looking miserable in those calsses?
20:47:29  < RichardLi> lolol
20:47:40  <   Juntray> image rollovers
20:47:47  <   Juntray> show captiosn of what those calsses are?
20:47:58  <   Juntray> yeah, this sounds feasible. If we had  more time and we didn't have tests/other stuff to do >.>
20:48:23  <   Juntray> and finally, our fifth page... what do.
20:48:28  <   Juntray> links to other resources?
20:48:38  < RichardLi> about page
20:48:41  < RichardLi> lol
20:48:43  <   Juntray> We can stick the if statement in the for or while loop
20:48:44  < RichardLi> sure
20:48:44  <   Juntray> yeah soudns good
20:48:47  < RichardLi> we can put lous list
20:48:49  <   Juntray> if on highlght
